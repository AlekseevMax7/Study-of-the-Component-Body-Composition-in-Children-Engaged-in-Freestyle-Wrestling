Type of work: Research project

Objective: to measure and analyze body dimensions and bone structure in children with varying experience in freestyle wrestling, and to assess differences in muscle, fat, and bone composition depending on the duration of sports training. 

Methods of research: The study involved systematic data collection of anthropometric measurements in young athletes grouped by training experience. Using validated formulas, key body composition metrics were derived and normalized as relative percentages of total body weight. The dataset was then subjected to statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing with Student’s t-test, to identify significant differences and correlations between groups, demonstrating data-driven insights into the effects of training duration on physical development.

Key skills:

•	Data collection & Preprocessing

•	Exploratory data analysis

•	Statistical analysis

Main results: The analysis revealed significant differences in muscle and fat composition between children with 1–2 years (Group I) and 4–5 years (Group II) of wrestling experience. Group II demonstrated an 8.4% increase in muscle mass percentage and a 9.3% decrease in fat mass percentage (p ≤ 0.05), indicating positive physical adaptations due to prolonged training. Differences in bone mass were not statistically significant, although they showed a similar upward trend in Group II.
